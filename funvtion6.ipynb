        "1....... What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computing. It provides powerful data structures like the multidimensional array (ndarray) and functions for performing efficient mathematical operations. It's widely used due to:\n",
        "\n",
        "High performance (vectorized operations in C)\n",
        "\n",
        "Convenient syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensive functionality (e.g., linear algebra, FFT, random number generation)\n",
        "\n",
        "2......How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding their dimensions without copying data. This simplifies code and enhances performance by avoiding explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "3....... What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types (like a table in SQL or Excel). It is ideal for data manipulation and analysis in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "4......... Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas\n",
        "The groupby() method is used to split data into groups based on a key (e.g., a column), apply a function (like mean or sum), and combine the results. It’s fundamental for data aggregation and summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "5....... Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "Seaborn is preferred because it builds on Matplotlib and provides:\n",

        "\n",
        "8...... What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?\n",
        "A vectorized operation refers to performing operations on entire arrays rather than element by element. This is faster and more concise, leveraging low-level optimizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "9...... How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n",
        "Matplotlib is static and traditional, suitable for publications.\n",

        "The pairplot() function creates a matrix of scatter plots (and histograms/ KDEs) for each pair of variables. It’s useful for exploring relationships in multivariate datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "12...... What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?\n",
        "The describe() function provides a quick statistical summary of numeric (or categorical, with include='all') columns, including count, mean, std, min, and quartiles.\n",
